Overstrike -- an open-source mod manager for PC ports of Insomniac Games' games.

# Installation

Overstrike is made for 64-bit version of Windows.
On Linux, you can try using Proton to run it, but it's not guaranteed to work.

To run, it needs x64 version of .NET 7.0 Desktop Runtime installed:
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-7.0.10-windows-x64-installer?cid=getdotnetcore

Overstrike is the same for every supported game, so you only need to download
it once. Extract it anywhere you'd like and run 'Overstrike.exe'.

# Launching

On first launch, it detects supported games in their usual installation
locations, and suggests to create a profile for each. You can add more manually,
and then switch between these profiles on the fly, and have as many profiles
as you'd like.

If launched from the SMPC Tool folder, Overstrike will suggest to import mods
from it, keeping their load order.

On every launch, it scans the 'Mods Library/' folder to find all the supported
mods. It can also detect and work with mods within .7z, .zip or .rar archives.

# Mods

In the Mods tab, you can see all the mods found in your library folder that
are compatible with the game your profile is for. Mods can be reordered using
drag'n'drop, and disabled by unticking a checkbox next to them. The list
supports multiselect with Ctrl and Shift. You can press Delete key to delete
selected mods from 'Mods Library/'.

To apply currently enabled mods to the game, you need to press "Install mods"
button. If order was changed, mods were added, removed, enabled or disabled,
this button needs to be pressed again.

After installation process, it shows a "Mods installed!" message in the left
bottom corner, meaning you can launch the game and play. However, if the process
stops abruptly, message would say "Error occurred." and a detailed message would
be added to the end of 'errors.log' file.

# Suits Menu

This tab only appears for games that support .suit mods.
It allows you to organize the suits displayed in game's menu the way you'd like.

In order to see modded suits here, press "Install mods" on Mods tab first.

Use drag'n'drop to reorder suits. Delete or modify selected suit via controls
on the right.

After you press "Save", you need press "Install mods" again to apply your
changes to the game.

# Settings

- Cache Mods Library contents -- makes scans faster.
- Skip Mods Library sync if cache present -- doesn't run the scan automatically
  if there's a cache. You'd need to press Refresh manually to run the scan.

For games that support .suit mods, you can also choose the language here.

# Troubleshooting

If Overstrike fails to install a mod, it leaves the game unmodded and writes
a detailed report in 'errors.log' file. Latest report is in the end of file.

If the game crashes on launch, it could be because your 'toc' or save files
are corrupted. You can try the following:

## "toc reset"

1) find 'toc' and 'toc.BAK' in game folder;
2) delete those files;
3) verify game files through Steam or EGS, so it downloads you a clean 'toc'.

After you do this, the game should be in unmodded state, and launch without any
problems. Simply reinstall mods after that.

## Replacing saves

If you install too many .suit mods, you can reach "suits limit", corrupting your
saves and causing the crash. Limit includes uninstalled suits, and is around
70-80 suits.

1) disable saves cloud sync in Steam or EGS;
2) remove your saves;
3) put some clean saves instead. You can find them on Nexus.
